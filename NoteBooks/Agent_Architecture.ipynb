      "> The paper introduces the **Transformer**, a sequence‑to‑sequence model that dispenses with recurrence and convolutions entirely, relying only on a novel **self‑attention** mechanism.  The Transformer achieves state‑of‑the‑art results on WMT 2014 English‑German and English‑French translation tasks while training 3–6× faster than comparable RNN‑based models.  The authors also show that the model scales well to longer sequences and can be trained on a single GPU.\n",

      "*Attention Is All You Need* demonstrates that a fully attention‑based architecture can replace recurrent and convolutional layers in sequence‑to‑sequence tasks, delivering superior accuracy and dramatically faster training. Its elegant design—scaled dot‑product attention, multi‑head parallelism, and sinusoidal positional encodings—has become the backbone of modern NLP. While memory constraints and positional encoding choices remain areas for improvement, the Transformer’s influence is undeniable, shaping the trajectory of deep learning research for years to come.\n"
