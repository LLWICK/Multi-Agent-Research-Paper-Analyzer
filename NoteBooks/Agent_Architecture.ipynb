      "* **Support for claims:** Every major claim (BLEU improvement, speed, scalability, transferability) is substantiated with quantitative results and ablations.  \n",

The methodology set a benchmark for reproducibility and has stood the test of time, as later, larger‑scale Transformer variants continue to improve upon the same core architecture.\n"

      "The Transformer demonstrates that a purely attention‑based architecture can outperform the best recurrent and convolutional models on large‑scale translation tasks while drastically reducing training time. Its key innovations—scaled dot‑product attention, multi‑head attention, and sinusoidal positional encoding—enable efficient parallelization and capture long‑range dependencies without recurrence. The paper’s extensive experiments on WMT 2014 datasets confirm the model’s effectiveness and set a new benchmark for sequence transduction.\u001b[0m\n",

      "- **Architecture**\n",
      "  - 6 identical encoder/decoder layers (base model; 12 for the big model).\n",
      "  - Encoder layer: multi‑head self‑attention → feed‑forward network.\n",
      "  - Decoder layer: masked self‑attention → encoder‑decoder attention → feed‑forward.\n",
      "  - Residual connections + layer‑norm around every sub‑layer.\n",

      "  - **Scaled Dot‑Product Attention**: `Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√dk) V`.\n",
      "  - **Multi‑head attention**: parallel heads (`h`), each with its own linear projections, concatenated and projected back.\n",
      "  - Masking in the decoder prevents future tokens from influencing current predictions.\n",
      "- **Positional encoding**\n",
      "  - Sinusoidal functions (`sin`, `cos`) provide order information without learnable parameters; learned embeddings perform similarly.\n",

      "- **Ablations**\n",
      "  - Reducing key size (`dk`) degrades performance.\n",
      "  - Learned positional embeddings ≈ sinusoidal ones.\n",
      "- **Conclusions**\n",
      "  - Attention alone suffices for sequence transduction.\n",
