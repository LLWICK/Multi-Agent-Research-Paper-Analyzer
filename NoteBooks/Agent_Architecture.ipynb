      "\n",
      "#### 2.1 Scaled Dot‑Product Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "**Formula (in plain English)**  \n",
      "1. Take three matrices: **Q** (queries), **K** (keys), **V** (values).  \n",
      "2. Compute a score for every pair of query and key: `score = (Q · Kᵀ) / sqrt(d_k)`.  \n",
      "3. Turn scores into probabilities with `softmax`.  \n",
      "4. Multiply these probabilities by the values: `output = probs · V`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why the scaling?**  \n",
      "If the dimensionality `d_k` is large, the raw dot products become huge, pushing the softmax into a very sharp distribution (almost one-hot).  \n",
      "Dividing by `sqrt(d_k)` keeps the values in a reasonable range.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy**  \n",
      "Think of each word as a *question* (Q).  \n",
      "The keys are *possible answers* (K).  \n",
      "The values are the *content* of those answers (V).  \n",
      "The dot product tells us how well a question matches an answer; the softmax turns that into a “probability” that the question will use that answer.  \n",
      "Finally, we combine the answers weighted by those probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.2 Multi‑Head Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of doing one big attention operation, we split the work into **h** smaller “heads”.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Project Q, K, V into `h` lower‑dimensional spaces (`d_k = d_v = d_model / h`).  \n",
      "2. Run scaled dot‑product attention *in parallel* on each head.  \n",
      "3. Concatenate the results and project back to `d_model`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why multiple heads?**  \n",
      "Each head can learn a different “view” of the relationships: one might focus on syntax, another on semantics, another on word order.  \n",
      "It’s like having several pairs of glasses that each highlight a different feature of the same scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.3 Position‑wise Feed‑Forward Network (FFN)\n",

      "\n",

      "#### 2.1 Scaled Dot‑Product Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "**Formula (in plain English)**  \n",
      "1. Take three matrices: **Q** (queries), **K** (keys), **V** (values).  \n",
      "2. Compute a score for every pair of query and key: `score = (Q · Kᵀ) / sqrt(d_k)`.  \n",
      "3. Turn scores into probabilities with `softmax`.  \n",
      "4. Multiply these probabilities by the values: `output = probs · V`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why the scaling?**  \n",
      "If the dimensionality `d_k` is large, the raw dot products become huge, pushing the softmax into a very sharp distribution (almost one-hot).  \n",
      "Dividing by `sqrt(d_k)` keeps the values in a reasonable range.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy**  \n",
      "Think of each word as a *question* (Q).  \n",
      "The keys are *possible answers* (K).  \n",
      "The values are the *content* of those answers (V).  \n",
      "The dot product tells us how well a question matches an answer; the softmax turns that into a “probability” that the question will use that answer.  \n",
      "Finally, we combine the answers weighted by those probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2.2 Multi‑Head Attention\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of doing one big attention operation, we split the work into **h** smaller “heads”.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Project Q, K, V into `h` lower‑dimensional spaces (`d_k = d_v = d_model / h`).  \n",
      "2. Run scaled dot‑product attention *in parallel* on each head.  \n",
      "3. Concatenate the results and project back to `d_model`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why multiple heads?**  \n",
      "Each head can learn a different “view” of the relationships: one might focus on syntax, another on semantics, another on word order.  \n",
      "It’s like having several pairs of glasses that each highlight a different feature of the same scene.\n",
